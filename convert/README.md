# Pre-requisites
Using the [Geo Tracker app on an Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ilyabogdanovich.geotracker&hl=en_US&pli=1) which keeps track of the latitude and longitude coordinates.
Coordinates and path are marked on a map using Google Maps.

I have my profile set to the General settings which includes recording every 1 second.
When you go to the application, find your list of recorded walks/hikes. Each trip will have the Share icon.
You can choose between GPX, KML, and KMZ formats. I chose KML
You will be sent an email with an attachment you chose.

1. After downloading the attachment, drop it into the convert folder
2. Scroll down. You will see the `<gx:coord>` open and close tags. These hold the coordinates you will need to show on your Google Maps.
