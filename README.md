This repository is a list of the latitude longitude coordinates of the Ice Age Trail across the state of Wisconsin. The trail is split up into segments. This repo has a master branch that holds all of the segments, but they are also separated into different branches, so you could pull based on different branches if you want. I still have some cleanup work to do and will get to it once all the segments are complete.

After pulling locally and making sure you have up-to-date packages, just pull the index.html file up to your browser of choice.
